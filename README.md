PORTFOLIO PROJECTS
------------------
Working on the projects i have uploaded here have been equally challenging and rewarding as i am still learning as i progress. The repositories featured here represent both academic and independently conducted projects. While some analyses were completed as part of formal coursework and followed predefined guidelines, others were designed and executed independently to better reflect real-world analytical workflows. These projects focus on understanding the business question, preparing and querying data, defining meaningful KPIs, and communicating insights clearly through written analysis and visualisation.

PROJECT 1: UCI RETAIL UK ( R & RMD)
